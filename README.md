## Introduction
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying entities in text. This project aims to enhance NER performance across multiple domains by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MULTI-NER.git
cd MULTI-NER
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To train the model, use the following command:
```bash
python train.py --config configs/config.yaml
```
For evaluation:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path models/best_model.pth --data_path data/test_data.txt
```

## Datasets
The datasets used in this project are sourced from various domains to ensure robustness. Details about the datasets can be found in the `data/` directory.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture is based on [mention any specific architecture, e.g., BERT, LSTM, etc.]. Detailed information about the architecture can be found in the `docs/` directory.

## Results
The results of the experiments are documented in the `results/` directory. Key performance metrics include precision, recall, and F1-score.
